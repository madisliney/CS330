How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

In approaching designing software, it is important to have a solid design and plan. 
This will ensure that you do not waste additional time or have to rewrite a lot of code.
New design skills that I have learned through my work in CS330 include how to code graphics
in OpenGL. The application was new to me, and it also helped me learn some C++. When developing
programs, it was easiest for me to work in sections instead of jumping around in the code.
Adding basic shapes and then moving on to adding color, light, textures, etc. It wasn't until midway through
the course that I started getting a better grasp on OpenGL. The final last weeks really challenged me, but in
a positive way. Computer Science will help me reach my goals because it constantly challenges me
and enables me to continually learn something which is what I am looking for in a career.
